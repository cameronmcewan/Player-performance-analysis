# Analyzing Player Performance Metrics in Relation to Team Success

## Objective
The primary aim of this project is to investigate the correlation between individual player performance metrics and their team's success across a selected number of football seasons. Additionally, the project seeks to compare the performance metrics of different players to understand the variance in individual contributions and its impact on team performance. Through a comprehensive analysis, this project will provide insights that could be instrumental for team management in player selection, team formation, and strategizing for upcoming matches.

### Sub-Objectives

#### Correlation Analysis:
- Identify and analyze key performance metrics (e.g., goals, assists, defensive contributions, etc.) of individual players.
- Determine how these metrics correlate with the team's success, defined by match outcomes, league standings, and overall performance in a season.

#### Comparative Player Analysis:

- Select a group of players for comparative analysis based on their position, team, or other relevant criteria.
- Compare the performance metrics of these players to understand how individual contributions vary and what unique strengths each player brings to their team.

#### Impact Assessment:

- Assess the impact of standout individual performances on crucial matches and how they influence the team's success.
- Explore if there are any common traits among players that significantly contribute to the team's performance.

#### Trend Analysis:

- Analyze trends in player performance metrics over multiple seasons to identify any consistent patterns or anomalies.
- Determine if there are any discernable trends in how player performance metrics influence team success over time.

#### Visualization and dashboard:

- Develop comprehensive visualizations to illustrate the correlation between player performance metrics and team success.
- Create an interactive dashboard using Tableau to display the comparative analysis of different players and other key insights derived from the analysis.

## Expected Outcomes
- A detailed report illustrating the correlation between player performance metrics and team success, accompanied by a comparative analysis of selected players.
- An interactive dashboard encapsulating key findings, trends, and insights derived from the analysis, providing a visual platform for evaluating player and team performance.
- Recommendations for team management on how to leverage player performance metrics for better team formation and strategizing.

## Metrics for Success:
- Accurate and insightful analysis of player performance metrics and their correlation with team success.
- Comprehensive comparative analysis of selected players.
- Clear and informative visualizations that enhance understanding and interpretation of the analysis.
